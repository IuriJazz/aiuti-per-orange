La risposta di jazcap53

In similar situations, I've done well by putting something like the following into /etc/rc.local:

cd /path/to/my/script
./my_script.py &
cd -
echo `date +%Y-%b-%d_%H:%M:%S` > /tmp/ran_rc_local  # check that rc.local ran


This has worked on multiple versions of Fedora and on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, for both python and perl scripts.
