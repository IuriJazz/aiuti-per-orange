https://forum.armbian.com/topic/19237-armbian-upgrade-from-buster-to-bullseye/



I now did the update to bullseye. Worked without problem like described by Heisath. Here is what I did in detail:
# apt update
# apt upgrade
# nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/armbian.list    ->  comment out the armbian repo
# nano /etc/apt/sources.list                           ->  change from buster to bullseye

# apt update
# apt upgrade --without-new-pkgs
# apt full-upgrade
# reboot

# nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/armbian.list   -> reenable armbian repo
# apt update
# apt upgrade

cos√¨ facendo dovresti riuscire ad aggiornare perfettamente qualsiasi minipc
